        "In this project, the aim is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset comprising information from the Google Play Store. The dataset in question is divided into two main parts: \"Play Store Data.csv\" and \"User Reviews.csv\". The \"Play Store Data.csv\" file includes various details about apps available in the Google Play Store, such as app names, categories, ratings, reviews, size, installs, type (free or paid), price, content rating, genres, last updated, current version, and Android version. Meanwhile, the \"User Reviews.csv\" file contains user-generated reviews for these apps, providing insights into user sentiment and feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project's core objective is to extract valuable insights and trends from the dataset, which could be beneficial for developers, marketers, and analysts to understand the current app market landscape on the Google Play Store. It involves cleaning the data by handling missing values, converting non-numeric values to a suitable numeric format for analysis, and deriving additional metrics that could offer deeper insights into app performance and user preferences.We will answer some business questions in this project that can help us get some important insight from data.\n"

        "Low Point in 2012: The year 2012 shows the lowest point in average app ratings. It would be interesting to explore if any significant market events occurred around this time, such as a flood of new app entries or policy changes in the store.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recovery and Growth: Post-2012, there is a noticeable recovery and a steady growth in ratings. This could be due to app developers improving app quality, users becoming more familiar with the app ecosystem, or possibly adjustments in the app rating system itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stabilization Period: Between 2013 and 2016, the average rating stabilizes around 4.0. This could suggest market maturity where apps maintain a consistent quality, or it might reflect a period where there were no significant changes impacting user ratings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Uptrend in Recent Years: There's a clear upward trend from 2016 to 2018, indicating an improvement in average app ratings. This could be due to better app development practices, enhanced user engagement strategies, or perhaps a shift in the user base.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall Range: The overall range of the average ratings from the lowest to highest point is within a relatively narrow band (from about 3.8 to 4.3). This might suggest that while there are fluctuations, app quality—as perceived by users—does not vary drastically year over year."

        "1. Family, games,Tool category has the most number of apps.Therefore the developer can aim for developing a high quality app in less popular categories as there can be a scope for exploration in categories that are less explored.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Highest concentration of reviews is among the apps thar are rated between 4 and 5 which indicates that users might be less inclined to review poorly rated apps.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. There are differences in rating distributions across content ratings, most apps are rated above 4.0, with a trend toward a slightly lower median rating as the intended audience age increases. However, the \"Adults only 18+\" category bucks this trend, potentially due to the small number of apps with this rating.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Certain categories like \"Personalization\" ,\"Medical\" and \"Tools\" seem to have a relatively higher presence of paid apps. This could suggest that users may be more willing to pay for apps that offer utility or customization.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Niche Markets: Categories with a lower overall number of apps, including paid apps, might represent niche markets. These could be areas where specialized apps cater to specific user needs, and there may be opportunities for new entrants if they can provide value.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Mostly the paid apps lie below 50$ mark, this might be a strategy from developers to price the apps at a low entry price for impulse purchases by customers.\n",

        "9. Broad Compatibility: A significant proportion of apps support a wide range of Android versions (e.g., \"4.0.3 and up\"), suggesting developers aim for broad compatibility to reach a larger user base.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Modern Android Support: There is a notable percentage of apps that require more recent versions of Android (e.g., \"5.0 and up\"), indicating developers are taking advantage of newer Android features and technologies.\n",

        "12. Education and Event category has a high rating because these apps are fullfilling specific needs.\n",
